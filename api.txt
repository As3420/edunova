 ‚úÖ Notes

 All Admin routes require both `protect` (authentication) and `adminOnly` (role check) middleware.
 Image uploads for events and courses handled via `uploadToCloudinary('image')`.
 Auth routes have appropriate validation middleware for input sanitization.
 Rate limiting, CORS, XSS protection, and MongoDB sanitization are globally applied in the server.
